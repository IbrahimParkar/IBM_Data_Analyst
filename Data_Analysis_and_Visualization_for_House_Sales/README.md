# Data_Analysis_and_Visualization_for_House_Sales
This repository contains a data visualization project that focuses on analyzing and visualizing house sale prices in King County, USA, which includes Seattle. The dataset includes information on homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following variables:

id: A notation for a house
date: Date the house was sold
price: Sale price of the house (prediction target)
bedrooms: Number of bedrooms
bathrooms: Number of bathrooms
sqft_living: Square footage of the home
sqft_lot: Square footage of the lot
floors: Total floors (levels) in the house
waterfront: Indicates if the house has a view to a waterfront
view: Indicates if the house has been viewed
condition: Overall condition of the house
grade: Overall grade given to the housing unit based on the King County grading system
sqft_above: Square footage of the house apart from the basement
sqft_basement: Square footage of the basement
yr_built: Year the house was built
yr_renovated: Year when the house was renovated
zipcode: Zip code of the house
lat: Latitude coordinate
long: Longitude coordinate
sqft_living15: Living room area in 2015 (implies renovations)
sqft_lot15: Lot size area in 2015 (implies renovations)

# Project Highlights
1. Analyzed and visualized various aspects of the house sales data, including price distribution, bedroom and bathroom counts, square footage of homes and lots, house conditions, grades, and more.
2. Utilized popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
3. Explored correlations between different features and the house sale price.
4. Built and evaluated linear regression models to predict house prices based on different features.

# Instructions
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
