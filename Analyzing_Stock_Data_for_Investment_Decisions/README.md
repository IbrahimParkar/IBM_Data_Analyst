# Analyzing-Stock-Data-for-Investment-Decisions

Welcome to my Analyzing Stock Data for Investment Decisions project! In this project, I assume the role of a Data Analyst working for a startup investment firm that specializes in helping clients invest their money in stocks. The main objective of this project is to extract financial data, such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, from various sources using Python libraries and web scraping techniques. The project focuses on analyzing stocks of popular companies like Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

Once I collect the data, my task is to visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns and trends. A dashboard provides a clear view of key performance indicators, enabling me to showcase important insights effectively. I will leverage Plotly, a powerful data visualization library, to create interactive and informative visualizations.

To complete this project, I will be using Skills Network Labs, a sandbox environment for hands-on labs, and Watson Studio, a collaborative environment provided by IBM Cloud Pak for Data. These tools will allow me to practice the concepts learned, work with real-world data, and develop and deploy my Python projects efficiently.

# Course Prerequisites
This project assumes that I have completed the Python for Data Science, AI and Development course or possess equivalent skills in working with data and Python. The course has equipped me with foundational Python knowledge, and this project serves as an opportunity to apply those skills in a practical setting.
